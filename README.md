These are the source files and templates I used to generate my personal website "Sqvrltastic's Homepage" (currently hosted on GitHub pages).

I use HUGO SSG and I use my custom theme that I made from scratch.

Images are not included here, only the code itself.

I decided to post my source files here in case you want to see how I made something.
