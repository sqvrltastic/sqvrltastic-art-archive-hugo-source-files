These are the source files and templates I used to generate my personal website "Sqvrltastic Art Archive" (currently hosted on GitHub pages).

I use HUGO SSG and I use my custom theme that I made from scratch.

Images are not included here, only the code itself.

I decided to post my source files here because someone might find them useful to learn from, I hope. Hopefully my code isn't too garbage, but hey, it works?
