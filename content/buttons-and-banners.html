<h2>About buttons</h2>
<p>
  If you find this website interesting and/or useful and want to share it with
  others, you can put one of these 90s-style buttons/banners on your own website and
  link back to me. Please <strong>do not hotlink the images</strong> and thank you.

<details>
  <summary>What the hell are buttons?!</summary>
  <p>
    Buttons are small images, most commonly 88 by 31 pixel in size. They can be
    static or animated. They are a way for webmasters to exchange links in style
    and build a community of websites. They were really popular in the 90s and
    early 2000s and they are making a comeback.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have a personal website, you can use one of the button images
    and create an image-link that links to this website.

<h2>88x31</h2>
<h3>Image:</h3>
<img src="/assets/images/buttons/sqvrltastic.webp" alt="Sqvrltastic's Homepage" class="small-button">
<h3>Code:</h3>
<details>
  <summary>HTML (show code)</summary>
  <pre><code>&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://sqvrltastic.art/&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22; rel=&#x22;noopener noreferrer&#x22;&#x3E;
  &#x3C;img src=&#x22;./images/button-sqvrltastic.webp&#x22; alt=&#x22;Sqvrltastic&#x27;s Homepage&#x22;&#x3E;
&#x3C;/a&#x3E;</code></pre>
</details>

<p><strong>Replace the path to the image with your own relative link!</strong></p>

<p>Optional: add CSS to negate browser default zoom level:</p>
<details>
  <summary>CSS (show code)</summary>
  <pre><code>.small-button {
  /* code to make 88x31 buttons look crispier and negate browser zoom */
  inline-size: 4.2rem;
  aspect-ratio: 88/31;
  transform: scale(1);
}</code></pre>
</details>

<p>IMO, don't add <code>image-rendering: pixelated;</code> because it makes it look really weird and ugly on
  desktops with non-standard zoom.</p>
