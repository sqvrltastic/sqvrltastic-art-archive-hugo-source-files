    If you find this website interesting and/or useful and want to share it with
    others, you can put one of these 90s-style banners on your own website and
    link back to me. Please <strong>do not hotlink the images</strong> and thank you.

    <p>
      Buttons are small images, most commonly 88 by 31 pixel in size. They can be
      static or animated. They are a way for webmasters to exchange links in style
      and build a community of websites. They were really popular in the 90s and
      early 2000s and they are making a comeback.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a personal website, you can use one of the button images
      and create an image-link that links to this website.
