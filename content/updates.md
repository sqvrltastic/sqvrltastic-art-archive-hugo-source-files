## December 29th 2024

The year is ending soon. In the meantime, I added a new section to my website — my [blog](./blog) and I posted my very first [Full guide to RSS](./blog/full-guide-to-rss.html)!

As usual, I made some minor design and functionality changes to my website.

Also, _important notice!_ I decided to redo my RSS feed a bit, so you might want to unsubscribe & resubscribe and don't forget to clear your reader's cache for changes to show!

## December 26th 2024

First time posting new artwork in a while... Check it out here: [Christmas Dusty Attenborough](./gallery/lotgh-christmas-dusty.html)

Additionally, made some minor website changes and improvements. Rewrote some sections in "About" page again, nothing major though.

## December 14th 2024

Small addition to the "About me" page meant to clarify my stance of some further details regarding reposting my artwork.

## December 13th 2024

Added a button for Wiby, a web search engine specifically for old and indie websites. You can find it in my button collection.

## December 12th 2024

Added a 88x31 website button. Check it out [here](./buttons.html)!

Additionally, I rewrote the "About" page to make it more concise and fixed various typos and grammar mistakes throughout the site.

## December 3rd 2024

This website was created on December 3rd, 2024, hurray! It's built purely with HTML and CSS and with the help of HUGO website generator.
