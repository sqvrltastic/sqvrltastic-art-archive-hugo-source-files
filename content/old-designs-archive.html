        <strong>1.0 version</strong> —

    <figcaption><strong>1.5 version</strong> — mostly the same as first version, but slightly improved. Don't remember

    <img src="./assets/images/old-designs/design-03.avif" alt="design 2.0 version" class="image-generic">
    <figcaption><strong>2.0 version</strong> — I was pretty proud of this one... For a time. It's more clean,
        but still a bit basic. Timeframe: from 24-07-2025 to 01-01-2026.</figcaption>
