I use **Adobe Photoshop (2019 version)** as my drawing software of choice. ~~By the way, I'd argue that, not only is it _not_ morally wrong, it is, in fact, every artist's moral imperative to pirate Adobe's Software!..~~ For legal reasons, this is a joke.

My graphic tablet is **Wacom Cintiq Pro DTH-1320**.

As for 3D, I use **Blender** to make the model itself and then later texture it in **Substance Painter** (circa 2018 version).

For coding and development I use **Visual Studio Code**.

**My Visual Studio Code extensions:**

- Atom One Dark Theme
- <a href="https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LTeX+</a> — grammar and spell checker, pairs well with Google Docs spell check
- ~~Prettier code formatter~~ I no longer use it for HTML formatting because it adds trailing slashes to void elements.
- Debugger for Firefox
- HTML CSS Support
- CSS Nesting Syntax Highlighting
- JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
- HUGO Language and Syntax Support
- Live Server
