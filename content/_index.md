## Welcome

Hi, I'm sqvrltastic and I'm a digital artist. This is my main place for posting my artworks and sharing my thoughts. **Welcome to my website!** 🎨

The content on this site is **SFW**, but it is _not_ intended for children. Some artworks are slightly suggestive. Also, I swear, ~~a lot~~ _occasionally_. Keep that in mind.

## Contact

If you want to reach me, your best bet is to shoot me an **email** at [sqvrltastic@gmail.com](mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com); I check my email inbox regularly.

You can also sign my [guestbook](/guestbook/)!

I also have a profile on <a href="https://github.com/sqvrltastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and I post my art on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sqvrltastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, but I'm not as active there as I'm trying to limit my use of social media.

## Commissions

Commission status: **closed**.

I don't take commissions at the moment because, honestly, I just don't feel ready yet. For now, I am still focused on growing and developing a semi-consistent and efficient drawing process.
