Hi, I'm sqvrltastic and I'm a digital artist. **Welcome to my website!** 🎨

This is my main place for posting my artworks and sharing my thoughts.

The content on this site is SFW, but it is _not_ intended for children. Some artworks are slightly suggestive. Also, I swear, _occasionally_. Keep that in mind.

You can **subscribe** to the website's RSS feed to receive news and updates when I post, _no email or signup necessary_. If you don't know what RSS is, I wrote an explanation [here](/guides/how-to-subscribe/).

If you want to reach me, your best bet is to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com">sqvrltastic@gmail.com</a>; I check my email inbox regularly.

You can also sign my [guestbook](/guestbook/)!

I also have a profile on <a href="https://github.com/sqvrltastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and I post my art on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sqvrltastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, but I'm not as active there as I'm trying to limit my use of social media to art-related use cases only.

Commission status: **closed**.

I don't take commissions at the moment because, honestly, I just don't feel ready yet. For now, I am still focused on growing and developing a semi-consistent and efficient drawing process.
