Hi, I'm sqvrltastic and I'm a digital artist. Welcome to my website! 🎨

This is my main place for posting my artworks and sharing my thoughts. It's also an archive of all my work and my home base in case all social media sites become unusable hellscapes.

The content on this site is SFW, but it is _not_ intended for children. Some artworks might be slightly suggestive. Also, I swear, _occasionally_. Keep that in mind.

You can **subscribe** to the website's RSS feed to receive news and updates when I post, _no email or signup necessary_. If you don't know what RSS is, I wrote an explanation [here](./blog/how-to-subscribe.html).

If you want to reach me, your best bet is to shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com">**sqvrltastic@gmail.com**</a>; I check my email inbox regularly.

I also have a profile on <a href="https://github.com/sqvrltastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and I post my art on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sqvrltastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, but I'm not as active there as I'm trying to limit my use of social media to art-related use cases only.

Commission status: **closed**.
