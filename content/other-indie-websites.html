      <strong>Simple
        Recipes</strong>
      — a minimalist cooking website for the lazy and easily distracted ones.
      I treat it as a personal cooking scrapbook of sorts.

      I'm very particular in whom I want to feature here. I like high quality sites with good content. Now, that's a bit
      vague, so I'll specify:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your site is well-made at a technical level; it's responsive, accessible, has good contrast, images are
        optimized, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        It contains something more than just links to your socials, button wall and an about me page.
      </li>
      <li>
        My favorite websites are those that showcase <em>appealing</em> art, fanfiction, food recipes, or various
        technical guides. Those are some of the topics that I'm interested in, but the list is non-exhaustive.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you think that you qualify and you'd like to reach out, you can email me at <a
        href="mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com">sqvrltastic@gmail.com</a>, but if you don't get a reply, please don't take
      it
      personally.
