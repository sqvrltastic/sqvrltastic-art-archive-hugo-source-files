    <a href="https://simplerecipes.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Simple
        Recipes</strong></a>
    — a minimalist cooking website for the lazy and easily distracted ones.
    I treat it as a personal cooking scrapbook of sorts.

    I'm very particular in whom I want to feature here. I like high quality sites with good content. Now, that's a bit
    vague, so I'll specify:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your site is well-made at a technical level; it's responsive, accessible, has good contrast, images are
      optimized, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      It contains <em>something more</em> than just links to your socials, button wall, and an "about me" page <s> with
        a
        list of all your mental illnesses (bonus points if self-diagnosed via TikTok)</s>.
    </li>
    <li>
      My favorite websites are those that showcase <em>appealing</em> art, fanfiction, food recipes, or various
      technical guides. Those are some of the topics that I'm interested in, but the list is non-exhaustive.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you think that you qualify and you'd like to reach out, you can email me at <a
      href="mailto:sqvrltastic@gmail.com">sqvrltastic@gmail.com</a>, but if you don't get a reply, please don't take
    it
    personally.
