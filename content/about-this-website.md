<div>

This website was made with **HUGO website builder** and as of now, it is hosted on **GitHub pages**. My domain provider is **Porkbun**.

I created this site because I needed a place to host my artworks and social media sites and other "platforms" are becoming worse and worse by each day.

I use a custom HUGO theme that I made from scratch. If you want to take a look at my HUGO source files to see how I made this or that, you can find them in a <a href="https://github.com/sqvrltastic/sqvrltastic-art-archive-hugo-source-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated GitHub repo</a>. This site is 100% static, except the external Guestbook, of course.

_Sidenote: I was thinking of maybe making some sort of HUGO tutorial for beginners, or maybe something like an explanation how I made this site, but I'm not really some HUGO dev God or anything like that, so I don't feel like I'm qualified to make tutorials yet... But If there is interest I might make it. I just think that the default HUGO documentation isn't very beginner-friendly._

I created this website the way it is because I want it to be _mine_ and to appeal to me, first and foremost. I hate the current trend of "generic fruity-colored, rounded-corner (because it's sooo friendly and relatable riiiight? fuck off...), Bootstrap-style trash" that only appeals to out-of-touch Californian tech SEO leads. Bleh.

On a side note, I care a lot about web accessibility, so if you notice anything that I can improve regarding this website, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. For the record, I tested this website on Firefox and Edge and it should be displaying correctly on wide ranges of screen sizes. I also tested it with NVDA and most screen reader pronunciation should be fine. Keyboard-only navigation should work fine too.

Also, **do** feel free to copy some parts of the code of this website! Just don't rip everything word for word. No need to credit me either, although it is always appreciated.
