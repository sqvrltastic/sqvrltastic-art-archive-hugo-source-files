## General

This website was made with **HUGO website builder** and as of now, it is hosted on **GitHub pages**. My domain provider is **Porkbun**.

I created this site because I needed a place to host my artworks and social media sites and other "platforms" are becoming worse and worse by each day.

This website was created on **December 3rd 2024**. 🎂

## On "artist websites"

I created this website the way it is because I want it to be _mine_ and to appeal to me, first and foremost, design and content-wise.

There is this notion that an "artist website" is supposed to be this very formal business-only thing with its only purpose being marketing. You constantly hear various buzzwords such as "conversion rate", "hero section", "SEO", "call to action", "mailing list" (don't you fucking love more SPAM???), etc.

Then there are the various arbitrary rules your website is supposed to adhere to, like, you _have to_ have your photo up (fuck you, NEVER DOING THAT! smh), because it builds "trust", supposedly (What?! How??? LMAO) and your various website sections are filled with these generic cringe-inducing marketing-speak BULLSHIT phrases like "We are bringing your ideas to life" (Who "we"? Do you have a split personality or something? FFS... 🙄).

## Nerd shit

I use a custom Hugo theme that I made from scratch. For non-techie people, yes, I did code this site _mostly_ "from scratch", as I'm not a fan of no-code website builders or Wordpress. If you want to take a look at my source files (non minified and with comments) to see how I made this or that, you can find them in a <a href="https://github.com/sqvrltastic/sqvrltastic-art-archive-hugo-source-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated GitHub repo</a>. This site is 100% static, except the external Guestbook, of course.

On a side note, I care a lot about web accessibility, so if you notice anything that I can improve regarding this website, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. For the record, I tested this website on Firefox and Edge and it should be displaying correctly on wide ranges of screen sizes. I also tested it with NVDA and most screen reader pronunciation should be fine. Keyboard-only navigation should work fine too.

This site is made to be browsed primarily **on desktop**, because that's the patricians's way to surf the web. I do not subscribe to the "mobile-first" design philosophy because I think it's moronic. However, this site is, in fact, "mobile-compatible".

Also, **do** feel free to copy some parts of the code of this website! Just don't rip everything word for word. No need to credit me either, although it is always appreciated.
