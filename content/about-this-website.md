description: "Mostly just technical information about this website"

This website was made with **HUGO website builder** and as of now, it is hosted on **GitHub pages**. My domain provider is **Porkbun**.

I created this site because I needed a place to host my artworks and social media sites and other "platforms" are becoming worse and worse by each day.

This website was created on **December 3rd 2024**. 🎂

I use a custom Hugo theme that I made from scratch. If you want to take a look at my source files (non minified and with comments) to see how I made this or that, you can find them in a <a href="https://github.com/sqvrltastic/sqvrltastic-art-archive-hugo-source-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dedicated GitHub repo</a>. This site is 100% static, except the external Guestbook, of course.

**Credits to:** <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo Book Theme</a> for being the biggest inspiration for this site's current layout and style!

I created this website the way it is because I want it to be _mine_ and to appeal to me, first and foremost, design-wise.

On a side note, I care a lot about web accessibility, so if you notice anything that I can improve regarding this website, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. For the record, I tested this website on Firefox and Edge and it should be displaying correctly on wide ranges of screen sizes. I also tested it with NVDA and most screen reader pronunciation should be fine. Keyboard-only navigation should work fine too.

This site is made to be browsed primarily **on desktop**, because that's the patricians's way to surf the web. I do not subscribe to the "mobile-first" design philosophy because I think it's moronic. However, this site is, in fact, "mobile-compatible".

Also, **do** feel free to copy some parts of the code of this website! Just don't rip everything word for word. No need to credit me either, although it is always appreciated.
