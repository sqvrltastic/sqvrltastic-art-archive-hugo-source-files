## March 5th 2025

New Vermintide fan art; more elf girl! 🧝‍♀️

- [Thinking face Kerillian 🤔](.gallery/vermintide-kerillian-thinking-face.html)

## February 19th 2025

Deleted two blogpost (I just didn't like them, I feel like they were too low effort).

Changed my whole gallery template in HUGO to make it fully automated. This shouldn't affect anything too much for the end user though so you won't see many changes.

Fixed some broken links, changed some stuff, yada yada, the usual. Not worth mentioning here.

## February 13th 2025

~~My PC is still broken...~~ (it's fixed now). In the meantime, I rewrote and cleaned up a lot of CSS code on the website. For you this mostly means that there are some minor layout changes. 

Also, I added **a big RSS feed button** down in the footer section and a simple guide on how to subscribe to this website's updates right there as well. 

So if you haven't figured out how to do it already, hopefully how you will!

## February 9th 2025

~~Two new blogposts:~~
- ~~My PC died... 😭~~
- ~~Steam friend requests suck~~

## February 4th 2025

Minor website CSS changes! Just trying to make this website easier on the eyes. Also, I kept the main font being monospace, but now it will show as whatever default monospace font you have in your browser, not as _Courier New_ like before.

Additionally, updated [coding resources links](./links/coding-resources-links-dump.html) and added "Images: figcaption vs alt. text" link under accessibility section.

## January 30th 2025

Crazy to think that January is already ending. But, in any case, in today's update I added a whole new section to my website: [Links](./links)! I will be sharing other indie websites there, as well as resources that I find useful and just cool and funny stuff!

## January 28th 2025

Posted new artwork: [my 2025 redraw](./gallery/montenegro-chan-boba-tea-challenge-2025.html) of my older "Montenegro-chan doing boba tea challenge" piece.

Published [Markdown cheat sheet](./blog/markdown-cheat-sheet.html)

## January 21st 2025

Posted three new artworks:

- [Anatomical sketch studies of skulls](./gallery/anatomy-skull-sketch-dump.html)
- [Kerillian with massive elven ears](./gallery/vermintide-big-elf-ears-kerillian.html)
- [Sketch portrait of Kerillian](./gallery/vermintide-angry-kerillian-doodle.html)

## January 15th 2025

Added a new large 468x60 website banner. Check it out [here](./buttons.html).

## January 6th 2025

Created a new 176x62 banner for the website; it can be found in [Miscellaneous](./buttons.html).

Restructured the website a bit and added a 90s style enter page because I think they're cool!

Did some other minor changes and cleanup to site's code that are not worth mentioning here...

## January 5th 2025

Published two new blogposts: [Neocities and the (misguided) idolization of the old web](./blog/idolization-of-the-old-web.html) and [Please, stop posting your artwork to Twitter](./blog/stop-posting-artwork-to-twitter.html).

## January 3rd 2025

New blog post: [Plans for 2025 year](./blog/plans-for-2025-year.html).

## December 29th 2024

The year is ending soon. In the meantime, I added a new section to my website — my [blog](./blog) and I posted my very first [Full guide to RSS](./blog/full-guide-to-rss.html)!

As usual, I made some minor design and functionality changes to my website.

Also, _important notice!_ I decided to redo my RSS feed a bit, so you might want to unsubscribe & resubscribe and don't forget to clear your reader's cache for changes to show!

## December 26th 2024

First time posting new artwork in a while... Check it out here: [Christmas Dusty Attenborough](./gallery/lotgh-christmas-dusty.html)

Additionally, made some minor website changes and improvements. Rewrote some sections in "About" page again, nothing major though.

## December 14th 2024

Small addition to the "About me" page meant to clarify my stance of some further details regarding reposting my artwork.

## December 13th 2024

Added a button for Wiby, a web search engine specifically for old and indie websites. You can find it in my button collection.

## December 12th 2024

Added a 88x31 website button. Check it out [here](./buttons.html)!

Additionally, I rewrote the "About" page to make it more concise and fixed various typos and grammar mistakes throughout the site.

## December 3rd 2024

This website was created on December 3rd, 2024, hurray! It's built purely with HTML and CSS and with the help of HUGO website generator.
