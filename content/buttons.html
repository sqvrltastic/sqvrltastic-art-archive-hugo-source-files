<h1>Buttons</h1>
<h2>This website's buttons and banners</h2>
<p>
  If you find this website interesting and/or useful and want to share it with
  others, you can put one of these banners on your own website. To do so, simply
  copy and paste the code below each one. Hotlinking is fine and is actually
  preferred because it's easier to keep the embedded image up to date that way.
  Thank you.

  Optionally, you can add a class attribute to the image element and add the
  following CSS if you want to make it responsive:
</p>
<pre><code>.responsive-img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
</code></pre>
