<h1>Buttons</h1>
<p>
  If you find this website interesting and/or useful and want to share it with
  others, you can put one of these 90s-style banners on your own website and
  link back to me. Please do not hotlink the images and thank you.

  <summary>What the hell are buttons?!</summary>
  <p>
    Buttons are small images, most commonly 88 by 31 pixel in size. They can be
    static or animated. They are a way for webmasters to exchange links in style
    and build a community of websites. They were really popular in the 90s and
    early 2000s and they are making a comeback.

  <p>
    If you have a personal website, you can use one of the button/banner images
    and create an image-link that links to this website.
