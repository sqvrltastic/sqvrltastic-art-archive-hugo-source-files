I'm a somewhat introverted young woman in my mid-twenties. I'm a pretty private person and don't like sharing a lot about myself online. I grew up in an age when everybody was still somewhat apprehensive of the internet and you were advised to never share your real name or photos online. Nowadays, it's the opposite and I hate how normalized oversharing on the internet is, to the point that if you don't have a social media account, people think you are some sort of serial killer, but I digress.

I speak three languages fluently: English, Montenegrin and Russian (не 🐘). I was born to a Russian mother and Montenegrin father and I grew up and live in a small Balkan country called Montenegro. I love the sea and nature and hate big cities and annoying people. Furthermore, I like tinkering with tech, old and artsy media, cooking (check out my <a href="https://sqvrltastic.github.io/simple-recipes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cooking website</a> by the way!), minimalism, tidiness and being an insufferable stuck up contrarian and an elitist (_sometimes_). I guess you can say that I'm a tomboy with very stereotypically male interests.

Some random facts about me:

- I have grapheme-color **synestesia** (it's when you see colored letters and numbers in your head).
- My favorite colors are red (because it's bold, sexy and attention-grabbing) and teal (because it's the color of the sea).
- I never add any sugar or milk to my Earl Grey black tea and Turkish-style coffee.
- I'm an old-school **fujoshi**; Kuroshit and TF2 were my "fujo awakening".
- Coincidentally, I taught myself English language by reading Ao3 gay smut with a dictionary in hand, because Ficbook.net (Russian Wattpad) didn't have any fics with my fav rarepairs...
- My MBTI type is **INTJ-A** and most of my friends are INTPs or INFPs, although, to be frank, I see MBTI as nothing more than a fun personality quiz.

_"Why "sqvrltastic"?"_

It has a story attached to it, but I'm not telling it to anyone but my close friends. Also, I needed a unique and recognizable artist pseud, so there's that.
