I will be honest, I spend something like 3+ months developing her character design and rendering her and I'm still not 100% satisfied with the final piece.

The "mostly" finished piece has been sitting on my disc for a while and yet here was just something about the piece that just felt off and unappealing to me, but I didn't know how to fix it. Still, I spent so much time and effort on it that I still wanted to showcase it, so I took out the WIP, fixed the most glaring mistakes and prettied it up to the point that I think it's "good enough".

I really wanted to challenge myself with this piece and learn how to paint more realistic women and especially more masculine/androgynous physique. I definitely feel like I managed to hit my current skill ceiling and I did learn a lot about anatomy, so at least I'm happy for that part because for a while, I definitely felt like I hit a plateau in my art journey.

As for the character herself, she was just a player character I envisioned when doing my first Rogue Trader playthrough. A sort of rogue-ish, asshole with a heart of gold voidborn ex-space pirate queen turned Rogue Trader by luck. I like dogmatic characters too, but I wanted a more flexible alignment for my 1st playthrough, so the crime lord background seemed more fitting.
