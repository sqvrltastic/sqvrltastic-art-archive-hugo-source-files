My PC is still broken... (update: it's fixed now). In the meantime, I rewrote and cleaned up a lot of CSS code on the website. For you this mostly means that there are some minor layout changes. Also, I added a big RSS feed button down in the footer section and a simple guide on how to subscribe to this website's updates right there as well. So if you haven't figured out how to do it already, hopefully how you will!
