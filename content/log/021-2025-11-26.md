I finally added a guestbook! Honestly, it took me so long because I am very particular regarding the features I am looking for in such a service. I also hate relying on 3rd party services, but I am too lazy to figure out how to code my own solution. Self-hosting my own guestbooks is still something I am considering doing at some point, so consider this Atabook-powered guestbook a temporary solution. I will probably move web hosts by that point though.
