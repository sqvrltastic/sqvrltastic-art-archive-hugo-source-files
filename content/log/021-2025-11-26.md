I finally added a guestbook! Honestly it took me so long because I am very particular regarding features I'm looking for in such a service. I also hate relying on 3rd party services, but I am too lazy to figure out how to code my own solution. Self-hosting my own guestbooks is still something I am still considering doing at some point, so consider this Atabook-powered guestbook a temporary solution. I'll probably move webhosts by that point though.
