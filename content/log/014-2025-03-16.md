Updated my "Full guide to RSS"; added a small section at the bottom about on how to make your RSS feed autodiscoverable. Additionally, added some cool new sites in the "links" section. Oh and, you can now find the HUGO source files of this website on my GitHub, if you ever wondered how I made this site the way I did.
