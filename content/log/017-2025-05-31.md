I finally purchased a custom domain (sqvrltastic.art) with Porkbun! 🥳🎉 I will keep the old free GitHub Pages domain working for a while as a fallback, but I will be replacing all my old links with the new ones and I encourage you to update any as well if you have any materials from my site linked, or if you are subscribed with RSS! This is my first time purchasing a domain so bear with me if I inadvertently break something!
