Deleted two blog posts (I just didn't like them, I feel like they were too low effort).

Changed my whole gallery template in HUGO to make it fully automated. This shouldn't affect anything too much for the end user though so you won't see many changes.

Fixed some broken links, changed some stuff, yada yada, the usual. Not worth mentioning here.
