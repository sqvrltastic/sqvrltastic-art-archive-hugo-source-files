Version 3.0 of the website is live! 🎉 I pretty much changed the entire website and all its sections. Also, I updated the "Animating details HTML element with pure CSS (without calc-size(auto))" guide and the "100 Questions for Webmasters" journal post and yes it's now called Journal and not Blog. And I made a new 88x31 button. PLEASE UPDATE ANY BACKLINKS THANKS and sorry for the inconvenience!
