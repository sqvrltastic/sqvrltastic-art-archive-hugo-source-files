Minor website CSS changes! Just trying to make this website easier on the eyes. Also, I kept the main font being monospace, but now it will show as whatever default monospace font you have in your browser, not as _Courier New_ like before.

Additionally, updated [coding resources links](./links/coding-resources-links-dump.html) and added "Images: figcaption vs alt. text" link under accessibility section.
