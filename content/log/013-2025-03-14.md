I completely remade the template for the RSS news feed and the site's own updates feed. Well, mostly on the developer side, you yourself won't see many differences. Basically I made a template in HUGO and automated it, whereas previously I would code it by hand, which was pretty tedious and prone to making mistakes. Make sure to clear your reader's cache if you have any issues! Also, now every artwork has a small annotation below!
