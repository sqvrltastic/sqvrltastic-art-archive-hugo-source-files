# 100 Questions for Webmasters

A fun questionnaire I found, made by <a href="https://mouseling.net/100webmaster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mouseling</a>. I was itching to write something lately (and I'll probably update this site a bit later as well) and this is a perfect way to warm up my writing muscles. Warning for brutal honesty ahead.

<i>Also, I fixed a few of the author's typos and grammatical errors in the questions themselves here and there, just FYI.</i>

Anyway...

<b>1. Please introduce yourself.</b>

I'm sqvrltastic, a young woman in my mid 20s from Montenegro. I am an artist and an indie web enthusiast. I game and watch old anime in my spare time.

<b>2. How long have you been making websites?</b>

I think I made my first website waaay back in the late 2000/early 2010 era. It was a fan site for an anime Tokyo Mew Mew that I hand coded in Microsoft Frontpage. I think I hosted it at narod.ru at first, but when they removed the HTML editor I moved to uCoz. I don't remember what happened, but eventually I deleted it.

However, that was a long time ago and I abandoned coding after a while and got busy with other things. However, around a year ago I decided to actually learn website development _for real_ this time and I spent my free time pretty much learning most things from scratch, since a lot of web dev practices changed a lot since the late 2000s.

<b>3. And what got you into the hobby?</b>

I initially decided to create my first website at around 10 years old because I got inspired by this beautiful website called <a href="https://rainbow-knights.narod.ru/main01.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Рыцари Радуги — фан сайт (Rainbow Knight fan site</a>, hosted on narod.ru. It's dedicated to a Russian comic I loved at that time. I still think fondly of it, despite it being borderline lost media. _I remember._ Also, I loved the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240904105245/https://yula-jurnal.narod.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_Yula_ fan site</a> (archived copy) and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080106105145/https://www.yula-best.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official _Yula_ magazine page</a> (archived copy). There are some other anime related websites that I remember, I even remember the visuals, but I don't remember what they were called, unfortunately.

I remember this one site in particular that had some shoujo anime graphics, specifically a large banner at the top, a small chatbox/guestbook on the right side, and I think the content was in the center. I think the overall color palette was on the warmer side... I remember chatting with the webmistress and I remember she has a section on her site where you could send your own site for review and critique and it would then be featured there, and I sent mine and got some good feedback. 🙂 Unfortunately, I can't remember the site's name.

And I got into the hobby again because I became disillusioned with the state of the modern internet and social media. Also, I needed a place to serve as a safe haven for my art, and none of the social media really met my criteria anymore.

<b>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</b>

I would love it if the fanartists and fic writers that I follow on social media made a website for their works. Doesn't have to be anything fancy, in fact I prefer designs that are straightforward and don't get in the way. Just something that has an RSS fedd so I can follow them outside of their shitty walled garden platforms like Tumblr or Twitter.

<b>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</b>

I start by deciding what will be the core purpose of my site, and/or what kind of content I want to host on it. Then, I decide how to organize and structure said content and create design that fits.

<b>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</b>

I don't have any yet, for better or worse. I am very particular about what I like and what I am trying to achieve with my website and I have pretty high standards for myself and others. There are some websites on the indie web where I enjoy a lot of aspects of them, but there is always some part of them that I would do differently and in my opinion, "better". I guess it's the great thing about the personal web — you can always do your own thing the way you like it, irrespective of what is trendy at the moment.

<b>7. What's your favorite part about making websites?</b>

Honestly, I'm not sure. I guess I really like organizing things and cleaning up my code. It's probably not something that a lot of people that casually browse my site notice, but I am very meticulous about it.

<b>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</b>

Good design lol. Or rather, a _good_ maximalist, elaborate design that looks both pretty _and_ doesn't compromise the usability of the site and doesn't detract from the main content of the site. I think most webmasters at places like Neocities fail at both, if I'm being honest. That's the main reason I stick with a somewhat bland, _true minimalist_ design. I would like to design my own fancy graphics for my site, maybe one day...

<b>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</b>

Same layout on the entire site. I despise it when I click on a link and the whole layout changes, it feels really disorienting, like I accidentally landed on a whole different website. They can be done well, but most of the time they are done extremely poorly IMO.

<b>10. How confident are you with CSS?</b>

Pretty confident. I can do most things with CSS and HTML5 where others lean on JavaScript as a crutch.

<b>11. Do you know how to correctly use <code>&#x3C;dl&#x3E;</code> ?</b>

I had to google it. Never used it before.

<b>12. What is your favorite HTML element?</b>

Kind of a silly question. Favorite HTML element? Do you want me to sign your friendship book too, maybe?.. ~~Actually, it's <code>&#x3C;~~details~~&#x3E;</code>~~.

<b>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</b>

Check &#x3E;&#x3E;5.

<b>14. Do you know JavaScript?</b>

A bit.

<b>15. How about PHP?</b>

I don't know it, and I'd rather avoid it.

<b>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</b>

Well, _yeah_.

<b>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</b>

Content 100%. The job of the design is to frame it well and _get out of the way_, IMO.

<b>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</b>

Yes! I love my domain name. 💖

<b>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</b>

Hoo boy... Here it comes. Well, if I'm being _brutally honest_, I think most of them are pretty terrible, to put it mildly. I get that a lot of Neocities users are kids, but still... Bunch of shit code filled with self-absorbed navel-gazers with no style or substance. I truly wish the whole 90s Neocities LARP trend just fucking dies already. Also, a lot of actual web 1.0 sites were, in fact, pretty well-designed for the time and had quality content on them.

<b>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</b>

I don't go crazy over it.

<b>21. What is your opinion on buttons and banners?</b>

I love the concept of them, but I think that 88x31 is just too small. We need a bigger standard.

<b>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</b>

Not a fan. I prefer to write a short description of a site, as well as organize it in a grid or table. Just dumping a bunch of eye bleeding buttons together just seems trashy and low effort.

<b>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</b>

Similar. I'm mostly satisfied with my site.

<b>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</b>

Not at all lol. I might come off as immodest by saying this, but I genuinely believe that I'm a better coder than 99% of the indie web sphere and typical SEO slop sites.

<b>25. What text editor do you use?</b>

Visual Studio Code

<b>26. Why do you use that one?</b>

Because it's simple and it just works.

<b>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</b>

I host it on the same server.

<b>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</b>

Same shit really. I suppose the name "Neocities" is slightly less stupid than "Nekoweb".

<b>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</b>

My whole /public/ folder, a.k.a. ready-to-upload website files that I generate with HUGO, along with all the images, is 26.6MB in total.

<b>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</b>

~~Man, you know the situation with the indie web devs is dire when you need to ask such a question lol.~~

<b>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</b>

I prefer design that enhances, or at least, doesn't get in the way of me enjoying the website's _content_.

<b>32. Do you stick to certain colors? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</b>

No. At least, not intentionally. However, all of my websites are some variation of white, gray and black because those are neutral colors that work with everything.

<b>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</b>

No. Not at all. I have my comfy corner here away from all the noise ~~and idiots with custom Snoo avatars~~, why would I ever go back to normie social media? I guess I still use Reddit to engage with fandoms and hopefully drive the traffic here, so hopefully more people discover the joy of making a personal website.

<b>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</b>

Not yet, unfortunately. As you might have noticed, I am pretty argumentative and hold a lot of "unpopular" opinions regarding the state of the "Indie Web". I'm kind of a contrarian in general. I hate giving empty platitudes and I criticize things because I _care_. I would love to make more _female_ friends, someday, hopefully. I admit that I haven't really reached out to anyone yet either. Just lazy I suppose.

<b>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</b>

Yeah. They like it.

<b>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</b>

Not too often. Maybe once a month at best, or once every few months.

<b>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</b>

Not that often. Only when I have a very specific idea in mind, or my eye for good design improves.

<b>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</b>

Hobby-focused.

<b>39. Do you do web design professionally?</b>

Occasionally; usually as a one-off freelance side-gig.

<b>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</b>

I prefer to keep my work life private.

<b>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</b>

Not too often, but I do like emails.

<b>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</b>

I still use Reddit. Mostly to just post my art and check other's art. I browse Tumblr anonymously with Tumlook for fanart, but I dislike the site overall. That's mostly it.

<b>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</b>

Discord for friends and Telegram for family and older people.

<b>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</b>

Sometimes. Often though, I like to work in silence.

<b>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</b>

I have a separate website focused on cooking and recipes.

<b>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</b>

My art is mostly video game fan arts, with occasional shitposty OC content. As for blog, it's really anything I feel like writing at the time.

<b>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</b>

... Next question.

<b>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</b>

Haven't yet. See &#x3E;&#x3E;34

<b>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</b>

I don't have any complaints, aside that I still sometimes forget how to center a div, vertically

<b>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</b>

Too much to list really.

<b>51. What about underutilized practices, or things you think people should do more?</b>

I think both this and the previous question would require a separate blogpost to fully answer.

<b>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</b>

Yes! I love semantic HTML.

<b>53. Do you consider different browsers?</b>

I use Firefox primarily, but I do check my stuff on Edge (Chromium based). I avoid using features that don't have wide support.

<b>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</b>

Good ol' Firefox. Why should you use it? Well for starters, it's probably the only mainstream noncommercial open-source browser. You can also disable telemetry for good and install Ublock origin to watch YouTube without ads.

<b>55. And what OS are you on?</b>

Windows 11, for better or worse.

<b>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</b>

I have an X270 Thinkpad with Linux Mint installed on it. It's a good machine, but I use my PC for more than just internet browsing, you know.

<b>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</b>

Yes.

<b>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</b>

If you do it, I hope your motherboard dies and your porn folder gets wiped. Delete your site and never do web dev again.

<b>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</b>

Interesting in theory, most fail in practice. Most fan listings and webrings I've seen are either dead or broken, or they don't really have any curation and just accept whoever applies, leading to them being filled with low quality sites. Also, I think I prefer web directories. Maybe I'll start my own one day.

<b>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see on that sort of page?</b>

No. Not really my thing.

<b>61. Are your websites "cliché", in your opinion?</b>

I guess my design is a bit too plain, but it works.

<b>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</b>

A website that's focused on good quality content and with a design that's distinct yet elegant and not overwhelming. I do try to improve my site when I feel that _it's time_ and my skills have grown enough to fulfill my new vision.

<b>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</b>

I am, as you can see. But my website doesn't utilize any graphics yet.

<b>64. What are your favorite resource sites?</b>

MDN and w3schools for checking documentation.

<b>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</b>

Not really.

<b>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</b>

Have something to say. Don't just make a worthless nostalgiashit website because it's trendy. Follow the current web dev best practices and don't use obsolete techniques. Don't copy and paste code that you do not understand. Less is more. **Remember to touch grass.**

<b>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</b>

Everything in an external stylesheet.

<b>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</b>

Please don't.

<b>69. How about table-based layouts?</b>

This brings me back to my years of making a Tokyo Mew Mew fan site on narod.ru... Unless your goal is to mimic an actual 90s site, _don't_.

<b>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?</b>

I don't really think about layouts in that way to be honest. I guess I mostly use the single column, centered layout.

<b>71. Do you spend longer on HTML or CSS?</b>

I go back and forth.

<b>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</b>

No. I haven't really felt the need to.

<b>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</b>

I'm not really one to come up with elaborate layouts "naturally", so no.

<b>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</b>

I'd say advanced with HTML and CSS, but beginner with JavaScript (and Go for HUGO).

<b>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</b>

I sometimes use the "Inspect element" tool in Firefox, but other than that no, not really.

<b>76. How did _you_ learn how to make websites?</b>

Well, I watched some tutorials... But most importantly, I would actually try to create things that I had in mind and based on what I struggled with, I would do further research.

<b>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</b>

No, because it's bad for accessibility.

<b>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</b>

I don't use them and don't really have much to say.

<b>79. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</b>

I use rem for most things, and % or vh or vw when I need them. I almost never use px.

<b>80. Do you have a favorite font?</b>

I would say Helvetica, but that joke stopped being funny in the 2000s. I do genuinely like it though. Other than that, Open Sans is nice I guess (the font on this site). Also, I recently used Montserrat for a project of mine and liked that one too. I like a lot of monospace fonts as well, Consolas for example. I think they are easy to read, I hate Arial.

<b>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</b>

I don't see the point.

<b>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</b>

Occasionally.

<b>83. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</b>

Yes, I do bookmark sites that I like. I also meticulously organize my bookmarks and back them up every once in a while. I would be honored if someone bookmarked my site.

<b>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</b>

I hope they like my art. I know most people don't care for quality of code, unless something doesn't work, but I hope that people like how clean and well organized my code is. I am always striving to improve with both my art and coding skills.

<b>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</b>

I've chosen parts and built a PC for myself to work and game on.

<b>86. How often and for how long are you online?</b>

I spent a lot of time in front of my computer working and have Discord in the background, but I'm not in any of the large servers and I don't really "browse" the web all that much.

<b>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</b>

People who enjoy the same things I like, obviously.

<b>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</b>

I haven't heard it mentioned in a while. No, not really.

<b>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</b>

I wrote hello world in Python once. Jokes aside, no, I don't code aside from my website. I'd love to learn more about GO and JavaScript.

<b>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</b>

I use HUGO and aside from a steep learning curve, I like it. I'd say one minor downside is that it's a bit opinionated and kinda forces you into a blog format by default, but you can "tame it", so to say. Nonetheless, I think any SSG is an invaluable tool and you should absolutely learn one if you want to make something like an art website or a blog.

<b>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</b>

No, because it's bloat.

<b>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</b>

Yes and I prefer the forum format to social media. I mostly browse forums related to my interests.

<b>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</b>

I do everything in VSCode.

<b>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</b>

I don't think that I have that level of notoriety to be considered this or that yet.

<b>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</b>

I think my old work is, well, beginner-y, like yes it's bad, but I also recognize that it was a necessary stepping stone and I look at it with some sense of fondness.

<b>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</b>

I'd leave an archive ofc.

<b>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</b>

I'm very secretive.

<b>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</b>

Nuh uh.

<b>99. And do you optimize the images on your website?</b>

Of course.

<b>100. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? Other than exhausted.</b>

I kinda liked it. It's been fun. I love talking about my interests. Formatting this thing has been a bit of pain, though.
