## Resources for coding

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MDN Web Docs</a> — references and documentation on HTML, CSS and JavaScript; useful when you need to look up a particular tag or an attribute.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> W3Schools</a> — similar to abovementioned MDN; lots of documentation and tutorials.

<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Markdown Cheat Sheet</a> — Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text that is meant to be as easy-to-read as possible. It's used by a large amount of SSGs and also by platforms like Reddit and Discord for example. Though, the implementation and the amount of features varies slightly between the various platforms.

<a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ChatGPT</a> — _"What, an AI? Ewwww AI bad <span aria-hidden="true">>:(</span>"_. OK, now, hear me out... You don't have to use it if you don't want to, but it can still be a very useful tool. Just don't overrely on it _too much_. Do keep in mind that it does get things wrong sometimes, or it might give you outdated info, so it is a good practice to double-check the code and answers it gives you.

Hell, just in general, don't blindly copy-paste any code you find online without understanding what it does, be it human or AI generated. Still, it can be useful for, at least, pointing you in the right direction of what to research further. Also, I treat it as a sort of better search engine that actually gives me info I am looking for instead of SEO garbage with fluff that you get nowadays when searching in Google/Bing.

[Full Guide to RSS](./blog/full-guide-to-rss.html) — shameless self plug

[Markdown cheat sheet](./markdown-cheat-sheet.html) — another guide by me

Guide to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS flexbox</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS grid</a> by CSS-Tricks; self-explanatory.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-logical-properties-and-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Logical Properties and Values</a> by CSS-Tricks.

<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structured data markup for Google Search</a> and <a href="https://schema.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shema.org</a> — some _optional_ SEO stuff.

Get your website indexed and check search engine analytics:

<a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast Checker</a> — for checking if your colorful text is readable enough; useful for all you pastel lovers, _ahem_.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Colors</a> — a cheat sheet from W3Schools.

<a href="https://mothereff.in/html-entities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML entity encoder/decoder</a> — useful when you need to include chunks of HTML code on your website as text.

<a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe/t/resources-list-for-the-personal-web/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resources List for the Personal Web</a> (from 32bit cafe) — another useful links list.

<a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HUGO static site generator</a> — for making and managing static websites like this one. There are _many_ SSGs out there, HUGO is just the one I personally use.

Where to host (for free, OMG!):

- <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Pages</a> (my current hosting provider)
- <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neocities</a>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neocities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/neocities</a> — as much as I hate social media, this is one of the rare cases of actually friendly and helpful community for beginner webmasters.

When using search engines, appending "site:www.reddit.com" or "site:stackoverflow.com" at the end of a search query helps a lot when looking for a solution to a specific coding issue by filtering results to only those sites. Example: _"How to center a div site:www.reddit.com/r/webdev"_.
