# My PC died!!!

My year-old AMD PC that worked flawlessly and with which I had zero issues since building it, one day just randomly decided to die on me. How and why did this happen? I have no fucking idea. 

I have an ASUS board and 7800X3D CPU and Corsair RAM that is on the approved RAM list. I did run EXPO with a stock preset of 6000MT/s, and a very minimal undervolt of the CPU, but other than that, everything was stock. Never dabbled in any sort of advanced overclocking. Never had any issues. 

It all started one day when my PC decided to randomly reboot. No warning, no BSOD, just straight to reboot. I wasn't even doing anything demanding at the time, merely being in Discord call. I checked my temps, checked voltage, all stable, no overheating, nothing at all. 

Then I went to check the event viewer which showed a critical code 41 error. I didn't like that. I got a hunch that it might be my worst case scenario, it being hardware failure, especially since I don't recall installing any new updates or software. Still, I decided not to panic _just yet_, and wait to see if it happens again.

Two days go, and nothing. I almost thought that it was indeed nothing, probably some Windows glitch or something, and then it happened _again_, out of nowhere. I was drawing in Photoshop and luckily I did save my work just in time (it's another fan art of Kerillian!!!), when my PC decided to reboot itself again. 

And then the reboots started happening all the time, to the point that my PC has become unusable. I managed to back up my files and settings, right before my PC decided to completely kick the bucket and refused to even POST anymore. Now when I turn it on, I just get a perpetual yellow DRAM LED light indicating that there is an issue with RAM and I get the PC fans spinning. 

Now here I am stuck troubleshooting it and switching parts around. Not gonna lie, I did freak out and cried like a bitch a few times. Can't help myself really. My PC is everything to me: I draw, I code, I work on it, I **love** to play games and I chat with my long distance friends on it... Inb4 "touch grass loser" <span class="text-uppercase">how about go fuck yourself you smartass moron. **Fuck you.**</span>

P.S. I _really_ hope I can get it fixed ASAP... Working on it. I am a pretty techie person myself; I chose the parts and I built my current PC myself, but I'm still at a loss...
