~~I don't know why, but I keep struggling to get this website indexed by search
engine crawler bots. Supposedly, it should be an automated process, but it
just doesn't seem to work for me. I had to manually submit my page to Google
for it to get it indexed, but it only worked with the landing page.~~ Update: It's indexed now!

I don't know... To be honest, I'm at a loss of what causes it, but I suspect
that the issue might be with GitHub itself. I looked it up and apparently
other people seem to have similar issues with their websites hosted on GitHub
pages.

This is why I am thinking of eventually switching hosts and most likely buying
a custom domain in the near future. But it's not something that I'm gonna do
straight away as I have to research more about it and compare all the options
first.

Also, if you had similar issues with search engines and found a solution, I'd
appreciate it if you reach out to me and let me know what helped you...
