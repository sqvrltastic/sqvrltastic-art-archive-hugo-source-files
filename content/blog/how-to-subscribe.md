# How to subscribe to this website — a guide

_Want to receive updates when I post new content? No need to sign up with email or create an account!_
<p class="text-center h3"><strong>Here is how!👇️</strong></span>

## Step 1

Download an **RSS reader** for your platform:

- Windows & MacOS: **Fluent Reader**
- Linux: **Newsflash**
- Android: **Feeder**

... or any other RSS reader of your choice!

## Step 2

Launch the app. Find a button that says something like: "add new feed", or "add new source". Then, copy and paste the following link into the text field: <a href="https://sqvrltastic.github.io/rss.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sqvrltastic\.github\.io/rss\.xml</a>.
