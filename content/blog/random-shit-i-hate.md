# Random shit I hate

_"But uhmmm can we please ✨just let people enjoy things✨ ?"_

**No.**

Honestly, I just like hating things sometimes. Sometimes you just need to get some things out of your system, you know?

Each take has a corresponding 1 to 3 level of spiciness (🌶️) rating, based purely on _My own humble opinion™_.

***

## Take #1 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️

I hate the terms MLM and WLW. MLM sounds to me like multi-level marketing and WLW I don't even know how to pronounce. I much prefer the terms "yuri" and "yaoi", or "bara"; at least it's the terms for flowers in Japanese (except yaoi ofc). Or just good ol' gay and lesbian.  "Oh yeah, have you read this _double-u-el-double-u_ romance book?????" Bitch what???? Speak human language please. 

## Take #2 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️

I hate Reddit Snoos. They look extremely annoying. There is just something that makes me angry when I see some smug asshole with a custom-designed Snoo and it's always the most dogshit opinion out there. They have similar energy to Funkopops, where it looks like it's made for children or "heckin' quirky"  kidults and you know it's some fake nice millennial hiding behind it WHO JUST WANTS TO ENJOY THINGS GODDAMIT 😡

## Take #3 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️🌶️

I hate KPOP Demon Hunters. I have no idea why it got so big. It feels like a psyop. Mark my words, it will be forgotten in the next year and a half completely. When I first saw the trailer it felt like something a bunch of boomer suits would make when they go hmm what do kids like these days? Kpop and Arcane yeaaah let's combine it, oh and sprinkle some Winx club for ✨ nostalgia ✨, it will sell well. It genuinely looks manufactured in a lab for the stanley-cup-dubai-chocolate-labubu-doll kids. Also, it has this millennial-flavored humor that is just extremely cringe-inducing.

## Take #4 | Spicy level: 🌶️

I hate autumn and winter, mostly because here it's 99% just foul weather, strong, cold wind, dirt, floodings and everything feels wet and cold. It's not really a romantic ideal of picturesque snow fields or beautiful trees with golden leaves everywhere. It's genuinely depressing, especially when you are forced for whatever reason to go out and drudge through all that. I see people act like they are some mysterious introspective poet with a sense of superiority just because they like listening to rain sounds while sleeping or something. Fuck off... And I fully admit that I was such a person in my teenage years. I thought it made me cool. But really I was just lonely, isolated and had poor social skills (not anymore). Nowadays, I really like warm sunny weather. Not the heat though. It really does (pun not intended) _brighten my day_.

## Take #5 | Spicy level: 🌶️

I hate polyester clothing. WHY THE FUCK IS IT EVERYWHERE??? It feels slippery and disgusting. What's wrong with basic cotton? Huh? Can't even buy any sweatpants of gym clothes anymore without FUCKING POLYESTER EVERYWHERE. FUCKING DOGSHIT PLASTIC TRASH.

## Take #6 | Spicy level: 🌶️🌶️

Peanut butter is simply disgusting.
