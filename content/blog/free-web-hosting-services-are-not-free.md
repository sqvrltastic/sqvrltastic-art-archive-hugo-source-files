Seeing how Neocities is slowly falling apart, with Kyle only occasionally chiming in to solve only the most egregious and pressing technical issues, I've come to realize some things...

It's no secret that platforms like the aforementioned Neocities rapidly grew in popularity in recent years. While in theory, Creativity™ is "good", it has nonetheless led to the platform getting flooded with subjectively low quality, objectively extremely poorly optimized websites with stupidly large, bloated, uncompressed assets. I'm looking at you, _artists_ in particular (stop uploading your whole artworks as uncompressed 600dpi PNGs for fuck's sake). Not to mention that some people blatanly break Neocities ToS and just treat it as a free file hosting service... C'mon, you have Catbox for that...

"But it's hurr durr free! Muh self-expression muh creativity! LET PEOPLE HAVE FUN GODDAMIT! 😡"Are you stupid? Do you realize that nothing is truly free? Somebody is paying for your "free" ~~lunch~~ web hosting. The 1GB free limit is way, wayyy too generous. It just encourages using Neocities as a file dump. It should be cut down to something like, maybe 200MB, or 500MB _at most_. BTW... This is totally a 100% humblebrag — my whole website, with all assets, fonts, images, pages, everything; 300+ files in total, weighs just around 30MB at the time of writing this. I digress.

The point is, a free platform cannot exist, or it will be destined to introduce more aggressive monetization, if people keep flooding it with bloated, low quality content. I think you should either self-host, or pay for hosting if you don't care about being prudent about your file size weight. Consider this — do you think it's okay for a well-off, upper middle class girl to go to a thrift shop and buy every cute piece of clothing and then resell with a huge markup online? Technically, it's not illegal. But isn't that, at least a bit, kinda shitty?

_"So what are you suggesting we do, sqvrltastic? Should we just kick every unoptimized, blinkie-overloaded amateur website off Neocities?!"_

I am not suggesting anything. I am merely asking you to consider, that just how you should be mindful about gentrification issues regarding my thrift shop example, you should also treat _free_ web hosting not as an invitation to "do whatever you want _kween_ fuck social media amirite 🤪", but to approach it with care and consideration, or else it will stop being free, or exist at all.

P. S. I'm just glad that gh-pages aren't considered as cool and hip and aren't as appealing to your typical irony-poisoned, oldweb aesthetic LARPers that are so prevalent on Neocities and Nekoweb.
