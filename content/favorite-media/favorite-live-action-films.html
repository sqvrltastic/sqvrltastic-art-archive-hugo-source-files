    To be honest, I debated if I should even make this section, since I don't really have many picks. I do love some
    older analog films, but I suppose I just find traditional animation as a medium more appealing to me. I've watched a
    lot of old soviet and Russian movies as a kid that I kind of liked, but I don't remember very well. Maybe I'll
    rewatch some of them someday...
