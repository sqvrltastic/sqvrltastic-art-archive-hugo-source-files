        I rarely watch anime for the plot. I think in general we overestimate the importance of "plot" in film and other
        visual media.
        You can say that I mostly watch anime for the "vibes". A purely emotional experience, not tainted by "logic" or
        "story". I do really enjoy media with deep and complex characters though.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, I am of the opinion that art shouldn't really teach you anything per se or "convey a message",
        because
        that's boring and preachy. If you want to share your opinion on whatever subject, write an essay instead. Art is
        meant for exploration.

    <p>Oh and, I fucking hate shounen and FOTM slop, yeah.</p>

                The second full length film is good as well, but I love the traditional medium of the first film more.
                Don't
                really care for the subsequent TV series.

                Context: The party sees a bunch of shiny gems at the bottom of the ravine. Snusmumrik is asked if he
                wants
                to take some of the gems with him, to which he answers, and
                I don't remember the exact quote, so I'll try to paraphrase:
                "I don't need to own it. I will look at it for a while, so that I will always carry a memory of it with
                me".

                From back in the day, when fantasy anime were still good. It feels so old-school. Like a fairy tale or a
                fable, something that has been sorely missing from today's fantasy stories.

                Okay fun fact — I watched both films when I had really bad fever and couldn't sleep. It was certainly
                <em>an experience</em>. The first one is okay, but the animation is pretty dated. This one??? The
                "Bloodlust"? It's pure visual orgasm. They really don't make them like they used to anymore.

            <strong>Berserk (1997)</strong>
            <p>
                Now, now... People really misrepresent this anime online by making it look like some edgy gorefest for
                "alpha males" (cringe), when in reality, gore and violence is only a small part of it. The true beauty
                of Berserk is, in fact, in its quieter, more contemplative moments. Really though, it's just a good dark
                fantasy story. Yes, it has dark themes and violence, but they feel purposeful and aren't there just for
                the shock value.

                Honestly... It's kind of boring and I can't really put my finger on why. But I like the worldbuilding
                and
                the vibes are immaculate. 7/10 and my standards are very high.
