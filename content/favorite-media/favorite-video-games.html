<p>
    I'm an avid PC gamer and I love a lot of old-school games with a dark and gritty atmosphere. I also tend to
    enjoy
    games that evoke a certain feeling of solitude and isolation that I find
    strangely comforting.

        <p>
            "Thief" left a huge impact on me not only as a player, but as someone who is interested in the theory
            behind the
            video game medium as well. It opened my eyes and changed how I view game design forever. It really
            showed me
            what games as a medium can achieve, without trying to imitate movies like so many modern AAA
            games do (I fucking hate SONY movieslop games).
        </p>

            The remake... Is alright, but oh my God does it not live up
            to the
            original games, like, at all.

        <p>
            Only the first game and the DLCs are good and I will die on that hill. The rest is <em>trash</em>.
            Normies will say that the 2nd part is "still good" and while it's not "bad" per se, you can really
            see how it started to lose identity with brighter and more "realistic" art direction and other nonsense
            changes.

        <strong>Half-life 2</strong>
        <p>
            I played all games in the series, including the fan-made Black Mesa and with a hand on my heart I can
            say
            that the second game is genuinely better than the first. Don't get me wrong, I still liked the original
            Half-life, but it's definitely showing its age. I think one thing that annoys me the most with HL1 is
            that movement feels very slippery, like you're skating on ice. Jumping is very jank too, especially the
            Xen
            part parkour is pure cancer.

            I don't like the second game in the trilogy. I'm not exactly sure why tbh, but I remember guns feeling
            extra janky and also, I just got bored and couldn't finish it. The first and third games are great
            though. Don't care for mods.

            It's good but jank. You can get softlocked in the surface area level... Yeah, I learned it the hard way
            as a
            kid. Also, it's genuinely scary sometimes, much more than all the zoomercore "horror" garbage.

            This game really is a product of its time. It's trashy and horny, but honestly I'm not even mad. It's so
            over the top and ridiculous that it's actually kinda good. You are shooting nazi zombies and leather
            clad
            BDSM dominatrixes. Oh and the final boss is some guy with a sword. The shooting and movement genuinely
            feels
            really good though. Peak early 2000s kino.

            The original game is SOVL. Remake is trash. Like actually pure garbage. Only a reddior would like it.
            Nah
            you
            know
            what? Soulsborne
            peaked with Demon's souls and DS1 and everything else is pop culture rollslop for soulless golems. Also,
            the
            original soundtrack is the best in the series (DS1 plin plin plon gets a honorary mention). And Maiden
            Astraea is the best boss with the best theme. Play it on the PS3 emulator, it's... "Free". <em>Wink

            I didn't play the original one back in the day so I'm stuck with the remaster. Anyway, I still think
            this
            game is the best in the Dark Souls series. Oh, and of course, I have a dark magic twink character for
            PvP! I FUCKING LOVE WIZARDS IN BIG STUPID WIZARD

            I don't care what anybody says, I really like the atmosphere, environments and music in Skyrim and I
            played
            a lot of it back in the day, both vanilla and modded.

            Marazhai sucks and you aren't special for liking a conventionally attractive edgy BDSM elf twink LMAO.
            Get a
            grip and stop acting like you're some sort of hipster when you're literally the majority kek.

    <strong>Honorable mention:</strong> Witcher 3, but only the soundtrack. Now, the game is good, but pretty overrated
    and
    has lots of
    issues, sucky combat
    and ubishit-tier map design for one. But the soundtrack? It's great, really. It's quite unique and every song is
    very recognizable. Furthermore, I love that it sounds distinctly slavic, instead of your average forgettable
    Hans Zimmer-esque generic fantasy soundtrack.
