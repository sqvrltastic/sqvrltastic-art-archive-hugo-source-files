I'm an avid PC gamer and I love a lot of old school games with dark and gritty atmosphere, the likes of Thief, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Half-life, Wolfenstein, Dark souls and Demon's souls, etc.

A lot of those games evoke a certain feeling of solitude and isolation that I really gravitate too and find strangely comforting.

In particular, the original "Thief" trilogy of games left the biggest impact on me in how I view game design as a whole and showed me what games as a medium can achieve, without trying to imitate movies like so many modern AAA games do (\*cough\* Sony \*cough\*).

I also love a lot of weird, artsy and dark 80s and 90s anime. Angel's egg, Jin Roh: The Wolf brigade, Ghost in the shell, Vampire hunter D: Bloodlust, Legend of the galactic heroes, Berserk and such. I rarely watch anime for the plot. I think in general we overestimate the importance of "plot" in film and other visual media.

You can say that I mostly watch anime for the "vibes". A purely emotional experience, not tainted by "logic" or "story". I do really enjoy media with deep and complex characters though.

Oh, and, I'm a huge Warhammer fan, both 40K and Fantasy (not a fan of AoS though). I don't play the tabletop personally, but I do enjoy the audiobooks and video games.

In general, I am of the opinion that art shouldn't really teach you anything per se or _"convey a message"_, because that's boring and preachy. If you want to share your opinion on whatever subject, write an essay instead. Art is meant for exploration.
