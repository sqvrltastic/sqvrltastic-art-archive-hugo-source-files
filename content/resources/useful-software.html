<h2>For desktop (Windows & Linux)</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://joplinapp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joplin</a> — open source note-taking app.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qBittorent</a> — my open source
    torrent
    client of choice.
</p>

<h2>For Android</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F-Droid</a> — installable app store of
    FOSS
    (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">PipePipe</a> — my current favorite YouTube client for mobile. Has built-in adblock and
    sponsorblock, doesn't require a sign-in, but still lets you subscribe to channels locally and lets you customize its
    layout to make it less distracting. Also, lets you play audio with screen turned off!
</p>

<h2>Browser extensions (mainly for Firefox in my case)</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">UBlock
        Origin</a> — my favorite ad blocker. Also lets you block any section of a website that you find distracting,
    like
    home feed.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">SponsorBlock</a> — skip annoying YouTube sponsor segments, as well as some other
    useless video
    filler like "like and subscribe" reminders.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">NoScript</a> — lets you manually blacklist or whitelist each individual JavaScript on
    a website by website basis.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a> — my current password manager of choice. Has a mobile app too.
