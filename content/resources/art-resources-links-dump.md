## Art-related YouTube channels that I like

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProkoTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proko YouTube channel</a> — I feel like this is one of the best free resources out there for learning figure drawing.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheArtMentor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Art Mentor</a> — I like his advice on art commissions and his take on chasing social media popularity.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KristianNeeTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristian Nee</a> — soulful podcasts and interviews with various artists.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@artbookaddiction/videos">Artbook Addiction</a> — another relaxing channel with some thoughtful opinions on various art-related subjects.

## Color theory and lighting

_Sidenote: I feel like 95% of all "color theory" videos and tutorials online are completely useless in practice. At least, they haven't helped me in the slightest in trying to understand how to paint light and pick colors. Things that actually helped me understand how light works is studying 3D rendering in Blender and some of the following videos:_

## Miscellaneous

<a href="https://www.pureref.com/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PureRef</a> — useful free little software for keeping and managing a reference board.

<a href="https://anatomy360.info/skull-sketcher-v2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skull Sketcher v2</a> — small program that lets you spin and light a 3D model of a skull, useful for anatomy drawing practice.

<a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GX3Ax1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Male head 3D reference tool</a> and <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/6a0Par" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Female head 3D reference tool</a> by William Nguyen on ArtStation — again, another super useful drawing practice tool,

<a href="https://sketchfab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sketchfab</a> — this is a 3D model hosting website, but it's also a great way to look for various references that you can move and twist around.

<a href="https://colorhunt.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Color Hunt</a> — just some cool palettes for inspiration.

<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/photoshop-brushes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photoshop brushes</a> — self-explanatory. Huge collection of _free_ brushes.

<a href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glaze</a> and <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nightshade</a> — Windows-only software that adds a layer of protection to your images to prevent generative AI models from being successfully trained on them. _Effectiveness is being disputed._

<a href="https://www.escapemotions.com/products/rebelle/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebelle</a> — digital painting software that looks very promising, but I haven't personally tried it yet.
