## For desktop (Windows & Linux)

<a href="https://joplinapp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joplin</a> — open source note-taking app.

<a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qBittorent</a> — my open source torrent client of choice.

## For Android

<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">F-Droid</a> — installable app store of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform.

<a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PipePipe</a> — my current favorite YouTube client for mobile. Has built-in adblock and sponsorblock, doesn't require a sign-in, but still lets you subscribe to channels locally and lets you customize its layout to make it less distracting. Also, lets you play audio with screen turned off!

## Browser extensions (mainly for Firefox in my case)

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UBlock Origin</a> — my favorite ad blocker. Also lets you block any section of a website that you find distracting, like home feed.

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SponsorBlock</a> — skip annoying YouTube sponsor segments, as well as some other useless filler.

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NoScript</a> - lets you manually blacklist or whitelist each individual JavaScript on the website by website basis.

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitwarden</a> — my current password manager of choice. Has a mobile app too.
