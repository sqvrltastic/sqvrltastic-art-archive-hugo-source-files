<h2>Color theory and lighting</h2>

<div class="note-box">
    <p>
        <strong>Sidenote:</strong> I feel like 95% of all "color theory" videos and tutorials online are completely
        useless in practice.
        At least, they haven't helped me in the slightest in trying to understand how to paint light and pick colors.
        Things
        that actually helped me understand how light works is studying 3D rendering in Blender and some of the video
        listed
        below...
